Note this will contain all the different plots under different assumptions
The first folder is PCA
PCA - Contains the PCA plots for different normalisation conditions under different conditions
Each sub folder under PCA contains the different normalisation techniques used (fpqm,vst,rld etc)
Under each sub folder we have different images based on different conditions.
  i)all/overall contains PCA using all genes
  ii)var,mad,val - Contains PCA using the most genes which have the maximum variance, mad values and the maximum rowwise means.
                   These further have _100,500,1000 etc meaning based on the above values of top these number of genes.
  iii)diff - Contains PCA using degs with numbers indicating the log fold change.
